        <h4 class="feature-title">Support Local Producers</h4>
        <h4 class="feature-para" style="text-align: left; font-size: 17px;">Locally grown food is full of flavor. When grown locally, the crops are picked at their peak of ripeness versus being harvested early in order to be shipped and distributed to your local retail store.<br><br>
Local food has more nutrients. Local food has a shorter time between harvest and your table, and it is less likely that the nutrient value has decreased.<br><br>
Local food supports the local economy. The money that is spent with local farmers and growers all stays close to home and is reinvested with businesses and services in your community.<br><br>
Local food benefits the environment. By purchasing locally grown foods you help maintain farmland and green and/or open space in your community.<br><br>
Local foods promote a safer food supply. The more steps there are between you and your foodâ€™s source the more chances there are for contamination. Food grown in distant locations has the potential for food safety issues at harvesting, washing, shipping and distribution.<br><br>
Local growers can tell you how the food was grown. You can ask what practices they use to raise and harvest the crops. When you know where your food comes from and who grew it, you know a lot more about that food.</h4>
